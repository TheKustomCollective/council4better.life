# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is end-of-life concierge service?
End-of-life concierge service is a personalized approach to planning and managing funeral arrangements, legal documents, memorial services, and all the details surrounding end-of-life care. We act as your advocate and coordinator, handling logistics so families can focus on what matters most.

### Who should use Living Legacy?
Anyone who wants to:
- Plan ahead for peace of mind

### When should I start planning?
The best time to plan is when you're healthy and able to make clear decisions. We recommend starting at age 50 or when experiencing major life changes (marriage, divorce, health diagnosis, loss of a loved one).

### Who can access my information?
Only you and the individuals you explicitly designate can access your stored documents and plans. You maintain complete control over permissions and can revoke access at any time.
